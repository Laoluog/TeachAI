Introducing Teach.AI, your multilingual Teaching Assistant for High School & Middle School students. (and potentially college soon ðŸ‘€). 
On the student facing side, we provide the ability for students to interface directly with a voice agent capable of speaking almost 30 languages.

For students who study English as a 2nd language, this product can completely change the game. We strive to connect students to their work, regardless of
the proximity of their teacher. 

For teachers, we offer a suite of products. We facilitate grading homework and exams through photos, student analytics and data management, the ability to
directly see students conversations with the TAs, online meeting tools, and large scale communication with students.

We're scaling this product at a quick pace to reach people all over the world. Reach out to us @ laoluog@stanford.edu

Thanks!
