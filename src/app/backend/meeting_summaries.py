# We planned on coding this feature in but we didn't have enough time so we hard coded as a placeholder, but plan to implement the real thing soon. 
# We've hard coded it here, but we actually just made a script that can handle this exact functionality - Check it out in the repository!

EXAMPLE_MEETING_SUMMARY = """Intro to DSA Discussion

In today's Zoom meeting, Dr. Smith led a discussion on fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, focusing on time complexity, arrays, and linked lists. The session was highly interactive, with students engaging in both conceptual discussions and problem-solving exercises. Dr. Smith began by explaining the importance of analyzing algorithm efficiency using Big-O notation, providing examples such as O(1), O(n), and O(log n). The students then explored real-world applications of arrays and linked lists, debating their advantages and trade-offs in different scenarios.

Throughout the session, Varun Kute, Laolu Oguneye, Sam Tesfai, and Roberto Tamez actively participated by asking questions and contributing insights. Varun sought clarification on why linked lists are often preferred over arrays for frequent insertions and deletions. Laolu drew a connection between linked lists and dynamic memory allocation, questioning how modern programming languages manage memory under the hood. Sam brought up an example from a recent coding project, discussing how an inefficient approach led to performance issues and tying it back to time complexity analysis. Roberto demonstrated strong engagement by working through a problem involving array resizing and explaining his thought process to the group.

Student Participation Highlights:
Varun Kute asked about the practical use cases of linked lists vs. arrays and sought clarification on time complexity differences.
Laolu Oguneye connected DSA concepts to memory allocation and engaged in a deeper discussion on how languages like Python handle lists dynamically.
Sam Tesfai shared a real-world example of algorithm inefficiency in a past project and related it to Big-O complexity.
Roberto Tamez walked through an array resizing problem and articulated his reasoning to the group effectively.

Challenges Faced by Students:
Some students struggled with visualizing how linked lists operate in memory compared to arrays. The concept of pointers and node traversal was particularly difficult for those who had less experience with lower-level memory management. Additionally, understanding the difference between singly and doubly linked lists, and when to use each, posed a challenge. There was also some confusion around the amortized time complexity of dynamic array resizing, with students needing extra clarification on how and why array expansions impact performance.

Strengths Demonstrated by Students:
The students showed strong engagement and curiosity throughout the session, especially in connecting theoretical DSA concepts to real-world applications. They demonstrated solid foundational understanding of time complexity, with multiple students correctly identifying the efficiency of common operations. Another major strength was their willingness to collaborate and build upon each other's ideasâ€”Sam's real-world coding example sparked a productive discussion, and Roberto's problem-solving approach helped clarify array behavior for the group.

Additional Notes:
Dr. Smith provided a helpful analogy comparing linked lists to a chain of train cars to illustrate how elements are connected.
The group agreed that additional practice problems on linked lists would be beneficial for reinforcing concepts.
The next session will cover stacks and queues, with a focus on implementation and use cases.
Laolu suggested exploring more real-world coding scenarios in future discussions to make abstract concepts more concrete.

This meeting served as a strong foundational discussion, setting the stage for deeper dives into DSA topics in future sessions. ðŸš€"""
